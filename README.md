# Combined Calculator & Notes App with Firebase Authentication

A cross-platform Flutter application that combines a simple Calculator and a Notes app, secured with Firebase Authentication and backed by Firestore for persistent note storage. This project demonstrates modern Flutter UI, authentication, and cloud integration.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in securely using email & password (Firebase Auth).
- **Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations with a clean, responsive UI.
- **Notes App**: Create, edit, and delete notes. Notes are stored per user in Firestore.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are saved in the cloud and synced across devices.
- **Password Strength Meter**: Visual feedback during registration.
- **Logout**: Securely sign out from any device.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (3.8.1 or higher recommended)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for project setup)
- A Firebase project (see below)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidvashisth2005/Calculator-and-Notes-App-Combined
cd Calculator-and-Notes-App-Combined
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup
- Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Add Android, iOS, Web, and/or Desktop apps as needed.
- Download `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place them in the respective folders:
  - `android/app/google-services.json`
  - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- The project uses `lib/firebase_options.dart` generated by the FlutterFire CLI. If you change Firebase projects, regenerate this file:
  ```bash
  flutterfire configure
  ```
- Ensure your Firestore database is in **test mode** or set up appropriate security rules for development.

### 4. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```
- For web: `flutter run -d chrome`
- For desktop: `flutter run -d windows` (or `macos`, `linux`)

## 🔒 Authentication & Security
- Email/password authentication is fully implemented.
- Google and GitHub sign-in are scaffolded but not yet implemented (see `login_screen.dart`).
- Password strength is checked during registration.
- User notes are stored per user in Firestore under `artifacts/default-app-id/users/{userId}/notes`.
